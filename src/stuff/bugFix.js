          Finally, what do you call a software engineer that doesn't debug code?

          Nothing, because there isn't one

          Debugging of the code gave me an insight into the difference between
          'perfect code' they teach in tutorials, and code in the real world and
          industry. When deadlines have to be met, the product team does not
          care how efficient or clean the code is. Features that need to be

          capabilities of the Nodejs server.
